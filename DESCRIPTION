Description: LEGA provides functionality to process longitudinal data.
    It was specifically developed for data originating from the Swedish
    Prescribed Drug Register, but can like be applied to other types
    of data with similar structures. It can extract information on the 
    prescribed dose based on the accompanying dosage text in the SPDR, filter
    and aggregate this information in various ways (e.g, defining treatment
    periods based on temporally overlapping dispensations).
