# Longitudinal Exposure Generation and Analysis (LEGA)
LEGA is a suite of R functions that can generate and analyse exposures
for longitudinal data. An example could for instance be pharmacutical
data (e.g., drug dispensations) where there are more observations of this
data than for an outcome.

## Functionality
LEGA also includes an R-wrapper for Dr. Dose that is a prediction engine
to extract information from pharmaceutical prescription texts. This was
originally developed to use with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register.
See https://github.com/deepchocolate/drdose for more inormation.
